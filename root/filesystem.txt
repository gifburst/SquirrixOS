The new version of this shell



implements a virtual file system.



FileSystem.fs(v2.1)







Want to swap your workspace



with someone elses?







Just replace the FileSystem.fs file



with the required one, and boot



up the system! and your done!!







The name has to be FileSystem.fs



for it to work for now...







Bye!
